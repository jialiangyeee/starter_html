            <P>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather. He would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.</P>

            <h2>Juno Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/classic_juno.JPG" width = "400" alt="Black and brown dog asleep on his side">

            <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted before he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same size, hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with hip problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.</p> 
            <P>One of Junoâ€™s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making sure every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.</P>

            <h2>Oliver Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/oliver.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Meet Oliver, an 8-year-old labradoodle who embodies the true spirit of a gentle giant. His days are spent sprawled out on the living room rug, which he has affectionately claimed as his own. His favorite pastime is watching the world go by through the window, offering an occasional tail wag to passersby who take notice of his charming, fluffy appearance.</p> 
            <P>But as night falls, Oliver undergoes a dramatic transformation. It's as if he's been recharged with boundless energy. He dashes to his toy bin, selecting his most cherished plush toys and scattering them around the room. The real show begins when he starts a playful game of hide-and-seek, darting behind furniture and peeking out with mischievous eyes. His family often hears the telltale rustling of his toys and the pitter-patter of his paws as he orchestrates his late-night escapades.</P>
